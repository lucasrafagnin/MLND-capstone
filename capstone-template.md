### Domain Background

The project is a Kaggle competition¹ called House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. This dataset provide a great opportunity to practice some machine learning alghoritms and data science methods. The problem to be solved in this project is a very important theme in real estate world, I say this because I work in a company² that has web platforms that manage real estate in Brazil and believe that solutions like this would help the business.

### Problem Statement

In this project I will predict the house price based on some explanatory variables describing aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

### Datasets and Inputs

The data³ is provided by the Kaggle competition and has 79 explanatory variables with information about the residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset has 2 parts: 
- Training data included 1460 houses accompanied by 79 attributes and the sales price for each house.
- Testing data included 1459 houses with the same 79 attributes, but sales price was not included.
Of the 79 variables provided, 51 were categorical and 28 were continuous.

### Solution Statement

Firstly I will examine the features and their correlations, then process the data, filling the missing and nullable values, select features and apply mathematical functions or regression methods that trains the model. After that, with the model in hands the final performance can be evaluated by kaggle public leader board.

### Benchmark Model

For the benchmark model a comparison with the leaderboard will be used. In addition I will also use [this](https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard/output) submission (which got a score of 0.11420) as a benchmark of my model
